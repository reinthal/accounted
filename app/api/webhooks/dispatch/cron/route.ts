/**
 * GET /api/webhooks/dispatch/cron — per-minute webhook delivery dispatcher.
 *
 * Picks up due deliveries (pending or retry-due failed) and POSTs them to
 * their configured receivers. Each cycle handles up to 50 deliveries; with
 * the per-minute cadence this gives 3000/h headroom before deliveries start
 * to backlog. Bumps to a higher batch size or moves to a queue worker
 * (Vercel Queues, on the post-Phase-6 roadmap) are the migration path.
 *
 * Authenticated via CRON_SECRET (Authorization: Bearer ...). The route
 * returns the dispatch summary in the response body so an operator can grep
 * Vercel logs to see how many succeeded / failed / went dead per tick.
