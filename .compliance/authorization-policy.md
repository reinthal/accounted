# Authorization Policy

Status: **Approved Documented Security Decision**
Owner: Emil Mattsson (emil.mattsson@arcim.io)
Last reviewed: 2026-05-11

This document records authorization decisions for Accounted that go beyond the
default "the resource creator is the only person who can act on it" model.
It is the canonical reference for compliance reviewers (OWASP ASVS V8, ISO
27001:2022 A.5.1 / A.8.3 / A.8.5, SOC 2 CC6.1) when they encounter an
authorization check that uses `company_id` rather than `user_id`.

## Multi-tenant model

Accounted is a multi-tenant SaaS where the unit of business ownership is the
**company** (a row in `public.companies`). Users access companies through
the `company_members` table, which links a user to one or more companies
with a role (`owner` / `admin` / `member` / `viewer`).

The active company is resolved on every request by
`lib/supabase/middleware.ts`. Application code reads it via
`ctx.companyId` (extensions) or `companyId` resolved from the cookie. Row
Level Security policies on every business table use the `user_company_ids()`
DB helper to enforce membership.

The user is **never** the authoritative tenant identifier on its own. Any
business data ownership check that compares `user_id` to the actor's
`user.id` instead of the resource's `company_id` is a bug.

## Shared-resource model (default)

Business records inside a company are **shared resources**: any member of
the company can read and write them, subject to their role. This includes:

- Customer invoices and supplier invoices
- Journal entries and bank transactions
- Customers and suppliers
- Receipts and documents
- **Bank connections (Enable Banking PSD2)**
- Mapping rules, booking templates, counterparty templates
- Salary runs and AGI declarations
- Company settings

The role of the actor (owner, admin, member, viewer) restricts what
operations they can perform via `lib/auth/require-write.ts`, but does not
restrict *which records* they can act on. A viewer cannot post any journal
entry; a member can post any journal entry their company owns, regardless
of who originally drafted it.

### Why this is intentional

Accounted's users are small businesses and the bookkeepers / consultants they
share access with. Compliance scenarios that drive this model:

1. **Bookkeeper handover.** A consultant who connected a bank during
   onboarding might not be the same person who later configures account
   selection. Forcing `user_id` ownership would lock the second person
   out of fixing the first person's setup.
2. **Vacation cover.** A second admin must be able to disconnect a bank,
   approve a supplier invoice, or send a customer invoice when the
   primary user is unreachable.
3. **Audit trail under BFL 7 kap.** Swedish bookkeeping law requires a
   continuous audit trail per *company*, not per user. Locking entries
   to a single user would interrupt that trail at every personnel
   change.
4. **Role-based, not identity-based, separation of duties.** Where SoD
   matters (e.g. AGI submission, year-end close, salary approval) we
   enforce it through the `role` column on `company_members`, not by
   recording which specific user created the underlying record.

### Compensating controls

Although authorization is by `company_id`, the audit trail is by `user_id`:

- `journal_entries.user_id`, `transactions.user_id`, etc. record who
  *created* a record. These columns are never used for authorization,
  but they are preserved for the audit log and the immutable
  `audit_log` table.
- `event_log` rows include `user_id` so every privileged action
  (consent grants, invoice sends, period locks, document uploads) is
  attributable to a specific user even when authorization is shared.
- The `audit_log` table is immutable (DB trigger `audit_log_immutable`)
  and retained for 7 years per BFL.

## Specific decisions

### bank_connections — managed at company scope

**Decision.** Any active `company_members` row for a company can manage
any `bank_connection` belonging to that company. This covers `POST /connect`,
`PATCH /accounts`, `POST /sync`, and `DELETE /disconnect` in the
`enable-banking` extension.

**Why.** A bank connection is a company-level resource (it represents the
company's relationship to its bank under PSD2 consent obtained on behalf of
the company, not a personal banking relationship). Restricting management
to the user who initiated the OAuth flow would create a lockout failure
mode that exceeds the cross-tenant access risk of the broader model.

**Compensating audit.** Every state transition on a bank connection emits
a structured event persisted to `event_log` with both `user_id` and
`company_id`:

- `bank_connection.consent_granted` — PSD2 callback completed, account
  metadata stored, status `pending_selection`. Emitted from
  `app/api/extensions/enable-banking/callback/route.ts`.
- `bank_connection.account_selection_changed` — user chose which accounts
  to sync; status may transition `pending_selection → active`. Emitted
  from `PATCH /accounts` in `extensions/general/enable-banking/index.ts`.
- `bank_connection.revoked` — user disconnected the bank; PSD2 session is
  revoked at Enable Banking; status set to `revoked`. Emitted from
  `DELETE /disconnect`.

The `event_log` row carries: `connectionId`, `bankName`, `previousStatus`,
`newStatus`, `accountCount` / `enabledCount` / `totalCount`, `userId`,
`companyId`, `consentExpiresAt`. This is sufficient to attribute every
PSD2 consent decision to a specific user under that company.

## Reviewers' checklist

When reviewing a PR that touches authorization:

1. The check filters by **`company_id`** resolved from the verified
   request context (`ctx.companyId` in extensions; `companyId` in API
   routes). Never `user.id` as a substitute.
2. If `companyId` is absent, the handler returns `400`. Never falls
   back to a different identifier.
3. The actor's company membership is enforced by either RLS
   (`user_company_ids()` policy) or an explicit application-side check
   against `company_members`. Both is best.
4. Any state change is emitted as a structured event with `userId` and
   `companyId` so the audit trail remains attributable.
5. Where role-level restrictions apply, `requireWrite()` /
   `requireRole()` from `lib/auth/require-write.ts` enforces them.

Deviations from the shared-resource model (e.g. resources that *should*
be locked to a single user) must be added to this document with the same
"Decision / Why / Compensating audit" structure before merging.
